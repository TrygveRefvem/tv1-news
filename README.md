# News Explorer: Dynamic Mode Selector with LLM Integration

## Overview

News Explorer is a dynamic news app powered by the [World News API](https://worldnewsapi.com/) and Google's **Gemini** Large Language Model (LLM). The app fetches and displays news articles, allowing users to switch between different modes. Each mode dynamically updates the title and description, with rankings from 1 to 10 for a customized experience.

## How It Works

1. **News Fetching:**
   - On load, the app retrieves news articles from the World News API.
   - Data includes headlines, descriptions, and relevant metadata.

2. **Mode Selection:**
   - Modes are represented numerically (1â€“10).
   - Clicking a mode triggers the Gemini LLM to generate a mode-specific title and description.

3. **Dynamic Updates:**
   - Mode changes update the UI in real-time, modifying the displayed title and description.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand mode functionality to include more granular filters (e.g., categories or regions).
- Enable saving and sharing of favorite articles.
- Introduce analytics for user behavior and mode preferences.
